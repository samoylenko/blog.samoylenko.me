I thought it's impossible, and was so surprised when I tried and it just worked
under Debian Sid and Virtual Box with Windows 7 Pro.

Atmel Studio was a very easy install in a VM, and it had no problems finding my
USB programmers and devices attached to my host Linux machine. It's very good
news given that my new digital oscilloscope with logic analyzer arrives tomorrow
:)
