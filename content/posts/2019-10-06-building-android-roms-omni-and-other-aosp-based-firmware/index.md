**upd**: archiving my blog in 2021 and reading this post again, I am no longer a
fan of Sony phones and of Android.

Appears that buying a Sony Xperia phone several years ago was a good call - they
appeared to
[support OpenSource Android](https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/)
very well even for devices that are no longer officially supported, and they
even provide instructions on how how to unlock those devices, and build your own
ROMs based on
[AOSP - Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com). And they also
[published instructions](https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/guides/aosp-build-instructions)
on how to build Android 10 (Q) which was released just a few weeks ago!

But despite lots of documentation available on Internet, its still very hard to
start compiling Android-based ROMs even if you have access to all the source
code and have a good vendor like Sony. With this post, I want to share what I
learned so far.

In no way I can pretend to be an expert in this field. If you are looking for
one, I can recommend these guys:

- [https://sx.ix5.org/info/](https://sx.ix5.org/info/)
- [https://github.com/stefanhh0/](https://github.com/stefanhh0/)

By the way, everything I am writing about here is all described at
[https://source.android.com](https://source.android.com) and
[https://github.com/omnirom/android](https://github.com/omnirom/android), and I
am just putting pieces from different pages together here.

## **Setting up your build environment**

Android is based on Linux, so usually its built using Linux machines. There is
no support to build ROMs at Windows, and some support at MacOS. Here, I will
only be talking about Linux since never owned a Mac.

Also, please note that you need to have at least 200+Gb of disk space to
successfully build Android. I personally have 2TB since I build 3 different
ROMS: Omni, AOSP 9 and AOSP 10

Usually, it does not matter which distribution of Linux you use, but most build
systems out there
[use Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) as a standard](https://source.android.com/setup/build/requirements).
I tried many combinations, and it looks like most of those recommendations are
outdated. E.g. Android 9 (Pie) requires Java 8 to be built, and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
does not have it, so there's a hack to get that working. For example, Android
Project itself
[provides a Dockerfile](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/+/master/tools/docker)
that creates an image based on Ubuntu 14.04 for building Android ROMs. It worked
for me for some time, but I ended up just using a virtual machine with the
latest Ubuntu LTS.

Instructions below should work with most recent Ubuntu installations.

First, you need to install the required libraries and build tools:

```shell
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git-core gnupg flex bison gperf build-essential zip curl zlib1g-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 lib32ncurses5-dev x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev lib32z-dev ccache libgl1-mesa-dev libxml2-utils xsltproc unzip python openjdk-8-jdk libssl-dev lzip repo
```

Note that I've added an extra library `libssl-dev` which is not required for
AOSP builds, but is needed for OmniROM. And `lzip` which is needed if you want
to
[add OpenGApps](https://github.com/opengapps/aosp_build) to your custom ROM.

I am also using the latest version of the `repo` tool that is available in
Ubuntu repositories. It may be a bit out of date, but so far I did not have any
issues with it. I just don't like to add binaries to the OS manually anymore.

If you want to use the latest version of `repo` as everyone else recommends,
just run a couple more commands:

```shell
sudo wget -P /usr/local/bin https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo

sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/repo
```

The last step is to configure your `Git` user:

```shell
git config --global user.name "First Last"
git config --global user.email your@email
```

And that's it! Now we are ready to checkout Android and start compiling!

## Checking out Android code

### Initializing repository

Getting code in Android consists of two stages: first, you init the repository,
and then you synchronize (download) the code. And of course you start with
creating a directory for it:

```shell
mkdir android
cd android
```

### AOSP

Again, I am only repeating the existing documentation here, it's all very well
explained at AOSP website:
[https://source.android.com/setup/build/downloading#getting-the-files](https://source.android.com/setup/build/downloading#getting-the-files)

```shell
repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b <your branch>
```

In most cases you don't checkout the latest `master` branch and instead pick a
tag (or branch) corresponding to an Android version release - you can find the
list of branches here:
[https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest/+refs](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest/+refs)

Here's why: most vendors align their code, binaries, and corresponding
instructions with specific Android releases. For example, in
[instructions for my Sony phone](https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/guides/aosp-build-instructions)
I can only use `android-10.0.0_r1` while `android-10.0.0_r3` is already
available. Furthermore, at the moment of writing this,
[OpenGApps](https://opengapps.org/) which I am using, is not yet available for
Android 10, so I have to use Android 9 instead, and while the latest Android
release was `android-9.0.0_r48`, I can only use `r46` since that's the latest
Android 9 release my vendor provided their source code for.

Of course, probably we can try using different release versions of vendor code
and AOSP, but should there be any bugs, I currently don't have enough skills to
fix them.

### OmniROM

[Omni](https://www.omnirom.org/) is an amazing ROM based on AOSP. It has many
useful features and fixes while is not bloated with vendor software. I use Omni
as stable ROM for my phone between my experiments with AOSP, and the more I
learn about building my own version of AOSP, the more I see how great Omni is,
and how knowledgeable are people that build it.

To get Omni, the `repo init` command has to use a different URL:

```shell
repo init -u git://github.com/omnirom/android.git -b <branch>
```

With Omni, using branches is much easier - you just pick Android version. They
already took care about everything else. You still get the list of branches from
the Omni Github project itself, and it's definitely worth visiting it since
there they also provide very simple instructions on how to build there (I am
going to duplicate those instructions below with minor changes):

[https://github.com/omnirom/android](https://github.com/omnirom/android)

## Customizing your ROM

Usually you make the necessary customizations right after you initialized your
repo - this is where you add references to any components that you are adding to
your ROM. For example, if you want to
[add OpenGApps](https://github.com/opengapps/aosp_build), you just add an `xml`
file (with any name, for example, \`opengapps.xml\`) to the
`.repo/local_manifests/` directory. Below is my version of it. Note this just
copied from the OpenGapps AOSP instructions by the link above:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
<remote name="opengapps" fetch="https://github.com/opengapps/"  />
<remote name="gitlab" fetch="https://gitlab.opengapps.org/opengapps/"  />

<project path="vendor/opengapps/build" name="aosp_build" revision="master" remote="opengapps" />

<project path="vendor/opengapps/sources/all" name="all" clone-depth="1" revision="master" remote="gitlab" />

<!-- arm64 depends on arm -->
<project path="vendor/opengapps/sources/arm" name="arm" clone-depth="1" revision="master" remote="gitlab" />
<project path="vendor/opengapps/sources/arm64" name="arm64" clone-depth="1" revision="master" remote="gitlab" />

<project path="vendor/opengapps/sources/x86" name="x86" clone-depth="1" revision="master" remote="gitlab" />
<project path="vendor/opengapps/sources/x86_64" name="x86_64" clone-depth="1" revision="master" remote="gitlab" />

</manifest>
```

This way, you can also add and customize APKs and any open source software in
your build. Unfortunately, this is where I am still learning, so not much
information in this section yet - I will be updating it as soon as I have more
progress, and meanwhile you can find more information at the
[Android website](https://source.android.com/), and via the links I provide in
the end of this post.

Note that if you've read the OpenGApps AOSP instructions, they also require you
to change your `device.xml` settings, and you don't have the file after you just
initialized the repository. Usually this is done by forking the repository that
contains your `device.xml` and making the necessary changes in your fork. And
then you just ensure that your AOSP-based ROM's manifests point to your fork
instead of the original one. You can see lots of examples of this in the OmniROM
repository (and that also explains why everytime you look at someone's custom
Android ROM repos, you see dozens of forks of Android-related repositories)

Unfortunately, I am still in process of learning how to do this properly, so I
can't really point to any forks that I've made so far - instead, I just sync the
repo and do all my customizations just before starting the build. But that's a
wrong way to do that - all my changes are lost every time I update my local
repo. In the end of this post, I am sharing some links that can help you
understand this process better.

## Downloading code

After repository was initialized, its time to download (or synchronize - the
same command is used to update) code. This is a very long (hours, sometimes even
days) process, and below is an optimized command you can use that will help
making it faster. By the way, if you are using a VM or server like I do, it's
good time to use something like `[screen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen)`
so that you can disconnect from this session while its running:

```shell
repo sync --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags -j$(nproc --all)
```

### Creating a local mirror

If you are downloading AOSP, you will notice how slow it is. AOSP
[Downloading page](https://source.android.com/setup/build/downloading#using-a-local-mirror)
provides instructions on how to create a local mirror. Instructions below are
taken from there:

```shell
# Create a directory for your mirror
mkdir -p /path/to/my/mirror
cd /path/to/my/mirror

# Mirror AOSP repository
repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/mirror/manifest --mirror
repo sync
```

After that, you can init a repo by referring to your local mirror instead of
slow `android.googlesource.com`:

```shell
repo init -u /path/to/my/mirror/platform/manifest -b <your branch>
```

This saves a lot of time in my case, when I have two parallel Android repos, and
only spend time syncing mirror once. But note that it takes a lot of space. I
had to reserve 2 Tb only for my Android directories:

## Building the code

After you synchronized (and customized) the code, you can now start building it.
It's done in two simple steps:

### Step 1: Initialize environment

First, you run the `envsetup` script that initializes your local environment,
set paths to proper tools and defines required variables. This also means that
you need to run it every time you re-login. And this step is always the same for
all types of Androd-based ROMs:

```shell
source build/envsetup.sh
```

After that, you need to set a target for your build - and that's a matter of
preference how to do that. E.g. Sony's AOSP build recommends you running the
`lunch` command that will automatically fetch all information about available
device configurations and offer you to choose one. OmniROM, on contrary, will
offer you to run the `brunch` command that will fetch device configuration based
on your input and start the build.

This is unfortunately another item that I am still learning, so I will just put
both instructions:

```shell
# AOSP
lunch

# OmniROM
brunch <device name>
```

### Step 2: Start the build

After that, you can just run the `make` command, and the build will be started.
Note that it may take a couple of hours, and in the example command below I am
adding an argument to use all available CPU cores on the system:

```shell
make -j $(nproc --all)
```

It's normal to have warnings during the build, and in most cases they can be
safely ignored. I so far only once heard about an Android build that has no
warnings, but I never saw it with my own eyes. My plan however is to help get
rid of these warnings as soon as I gain the required knowledge.

## Flashing the new ROM

After the build is completed, your binaries will be available in the
`out/target/product/<your phone>` directory.

If you were building AOSP, you'll get images corresponding to partitions in your
Android phone, e.g:

boot.img cache.img recovery.img system.img userdata.img

And its normal if there's more `img` files than your phone has partitions (e.g.
in my case, there are always some `ramdisk` partitions). You can just ignore
those.

All you need now is just to flash the image files. Usually, image name will
correspond to a partition it goes to, e.g.:

```shell
fastboot flash boot boot.img
fastboot flash cache cache.img
fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
fastboot flash system system.img

# note that the following command deletes all data at your phone
fastboot flash userdata userdata.img 
```

Flashing is a large topic by itself, and its beyond this blogpost. For example,
with OmniROM, you'll get a `zip` archive instead of a bunch of image files. That
file can be flashed via tools like
[TWRP](https://twrp.me/) - just follow OmniROM instructions.

I personally prefer to use images, and I usually find `img` artifacts remained
from OmniROM build and flash them manually.
