[pwgen](http://man.cx/pwgen), my favorite Linux tool to generate random
passwords that can be memorized:

> guaranteed that users will simply write the password on a piece of paper taped

I like to see how alternative thinking in Information Security community is
emerging. Good that we started to realize people are not robots, and commands
and programming will never work here. This is basic risk management, to consider
‘human elements’ in any program. And while I am sure there are people who will
disagree and bring up some very good and solid arguments, I don’t understand why
in world of Information Security, one of the most modern and fast-evolving
professions, we are still trying to rely on ideas that are decades old, and
never really worked since…
